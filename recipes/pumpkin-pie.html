    <h2>Directions</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, combine the flour, sugar and salt. Using a fork, stir in oil and butter until dough is crumbly. Gradually add enough water until dough holds together. Roll out between sheets of waxed paper into an 11-in. circle. Freeze for 10 minutes. </li>
            <li>Remove top sheet of waxed paper; invert crust into a 9-in. pie plate. Remove the remaining waxed paper. Trim and flute edge. Chill. </li>
            <li>Roll dough scraps to 1/8-in. thickness. Cut with a 1-in. leaf-shaped cookie cutter. Place on an ungreased baking sheet; bake at 375° for 6-8 minutes or until edges are very lightly browned. Cool on a wire rack.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, beat the egg, egg white, sugars, salt and spices until smooth. Beat in pumpkin. Gradually beat in milk. Pour into crust. Bake at 375° for 45-50 minutes or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack. Garnish with leaf cutouts. If desired, top with whipped cream. Refrigerate leftovers.</li>
