    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Quick, Easy and Delicious-Homemade pizza crust and tomato sauce has never been easier-and this recipe for pepperoni pizza produces a delicious classic!
      </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>1-1/4 cups warm water (110° to 115°)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup canola oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3-1/2 to 4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 can (15 ounces) tomato sauce</li>
            <li>3 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>Pepperoni</li>
          </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>In large bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in water; let stand for 5 minutes. Add oil and salt. Stir in flour, 1 cup at a time, until a soft dough forms.</li>
            <li>Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, 2-3 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease the top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, cook beef and onion over medium heat until beef is no longer pink, breaking meat into crumbles; drain. </li>
            <li>Punch down dough; divide in half. Press each half into a greased 12-in. pizza pan. Combine the tomato sauce, oregano and basil; spread over each crust. Top with beef mixture, green pepper and cheese. </li>
            <li>Bake at 400° for 25-30 minutes or until crust is lightly browned.</li>
          </ol>
